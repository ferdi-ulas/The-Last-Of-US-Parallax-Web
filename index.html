                Joel lost his daughter years ago and continues his struggle to survive. One day, he is assigned to take
                Ellie, a little girl, from a group of rebels trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic world as a result
                of a worldwide epidemic. Ellie is one of the few people who are resistant to this epidemic thanks to her
                immunity, so Joel decides to take her to a safe place, to a group that can develop a vaccine. Joel and
                Ellie embark on a challenging journey and fight against countless dangers, infected creatures and traps
                created by humans on the way. As Joel takes on the responsibility of protecting Ellie, a strong bond
                develops between the two. However, the painful pasts experienced by both characters deepen the story in
                the process. After many dangers, Joel and Ellie reach a hospital where Ellie will undergo surgery in
                order to be used for the vaccine. However, Joel realizes that he cannot bear to lose Ellie and kills the
                hospital staff and kidnaps Ellie in order to save her. This decision leads Joel to conflict with his own
                conscience, because in order to survive in this world, sometimes it is necessary to question how much
                harm a person can do to others.
